/**
 * Represents a snapshot of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for a laboratory.
 *
 * @remarks
 * In Domain-Driven Design, KpiDashboard is an entity that aggregates various
 * performance metrics to provide a comprehensive view of operational health.
 * It serves as a point-in-time report for laboratory efficiency, equipment
 * availability, and quality compliance.
 *
 * This entity is primarily used for management dashboards and trend analysis
 * within the Reporting and Analysis bounded context.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const dashboard = new KpiDashboard({
 *   id: 1,
 *   laboratoryId: 10,
 *   timestamp: '2026-05-12T11:00:00Z',
 *   overallHealthScore: 92,
 *   metrics: []
 * });
 * ```
