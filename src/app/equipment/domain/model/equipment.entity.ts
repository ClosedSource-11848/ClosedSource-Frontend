/**
 * Represents an equipment entity within the laboratory or equipment management domain.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This entity models a physical equipment registered in the system. Each equipment
 * belongs to a specific laboratory and includes identification, classification,
 * technical, and operational status information.
 *
 * In a domain-driven design context, Equipment is an entity because it has a unique
 * identity that persists throughout its lifecycle, regardless of changes in its
 * attributes such as status, model, or name.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const equipment = new Equipment({
 * id: 1,
 * labId: 101,
 * name: 'Centrifuge',
 * type: 'Laboratory Equipment',
 * model: 'CF-3000',
 * serialNumber: 'SN-2026-001',
 * status: 'OPERATIONAL',
 * createdAt: '2026-05-12T10:00:00Z'
 * });
 *
 * console.log(equipment.name); // 'Centrifuge'
 * ```
