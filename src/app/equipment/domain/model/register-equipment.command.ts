/**
 * Represents a command used to register a new equipment in the system.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This command contains the required data to create or register an equipment
 * within a laboratory. It is commonly used in the application layer to execute
 * a use case related to equipment registration.
 *
 * The command does not represent a domain entity by itself. Instead, it carries
 * the input data needed to create an equipment record with its basic technical
 * and identification information.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const command: RegisterEquipmentCommand = {
 *   labId: 'lab-001',
 *   name: 'Centrifuge',
 *   type: 'Laboratory Equipment',
 *   model: 'CF-3000',
 *   serialNumber: 'SN-2026-001'
 * };
