/**
 * Represents a command used to link an external sensor to a specific equipment.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This command contains the required data to associate a sensor with an
 * equipment registered in the system. It is typically used in the application
 * layer to request the linking of a physical or external sensor device.
 *
 * The command does not represent a domain entity by itself. Instead, it carries
 * the input data needed to execute a use case related to equipment sensor
 * integration.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const command: LinkSensorCommand = {
 *   equipmentId: 'equipment-001',
 *   sensorExternalId: 'sensor-ext-001',
 *   sensorType: 'Temperature'
 * };
 * ```
