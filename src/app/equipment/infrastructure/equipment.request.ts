/**
 * Represents a request used to register a new equipment in the system.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This request contains the required data to create an equipment record
 * associated with a specific laboratory. It is commonly used in the
 * presentation or application layer when a user or client submits equipment
 * registration information.
 *
 * Unlike a domain entity, this request only carries input data needed to
 * register the equipment, including its laboratory assignment, name, type,
 * model, and serial number.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const request: RegisterEquipmentRequest = {
 * labId: 101,
 * name: 'Centrifuge',
 * type: 'Laboratory Equipment',
 * model: 'CF-3000',
 * serialNumber: 'SN-2026-001'
 * };
 * ```
